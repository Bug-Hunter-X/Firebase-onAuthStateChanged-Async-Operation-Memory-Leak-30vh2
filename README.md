# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Async Operation and Potential Memory Leaks
This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener with asynchronous operations in React.  The problem arises because if the component unmounts before the asynchronous operation completes, the callback can still execute, leading to potential memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Problem
The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is attached, and an asynchronous operation (fetching user data) is triggered. If the component unmounts before the data fetch completes, the callback might still update state or cause other problems.  This is because the unsubscribe function only removes the listener itself, not any actions taken within the listener's callback.

## Solution
The solution involves using a flag to track whether the component is mounted or unmounted.  This flag prevents the asynchronous operation's callback from executing if the component has already unmounted.  The `useIsMounted` hook helps manage the mounting state efficiently.
